MMORPG Demonstration Website
========================

I have done this application mostly for personnal purposes. It allowed me to try out some cool things from Symfony 2. 
So the website isn't owned by any group of players. The demo is available here: [http://webmixingshapes.net/ldc/][1].

### Application aims:

Website of a video game guild, MMORPG kind. The members would read community or game related news,
join events, discuss about anything.

### Notes:
- Forum not set up
- Pictures used are free for non commercial use
- Back office functional, not accessible for anonymous visitors
- Improves to come!
